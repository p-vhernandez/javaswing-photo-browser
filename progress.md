# Progress per assignment
## Lab 1
Create an sketelon application that:
- [x] Shows a new window (JFrame) when launched
- [x] Presents a MenuBar*
- [x] Shows an empty space as the main portion of the window (for now)
- [x] Shows a JLabel at the bottom of the window to act as a status bar
- [ ] Shows a toolbar at the left or top of the window. Include a JToggleButton to choose between different categories of photos (e.g. “People,” “Places,” “School”, etc.)
- [x] Can be resized using the actual window

The MenuBar should show the following:
- File:
  - Import -- should open a JFileChooser but do nothing with the choice for now
  - Delete -- will eventually delete a photo.
  - Quit -- exit the application
- View -- Contains a radio button for the view options:
  - Photo viewer (default) -- show one photo at a time
  - Browser -- will eventually show a grid of thumbnails

_All unimplemented functionality should, for now, just display a placeholder message to the status bar._
